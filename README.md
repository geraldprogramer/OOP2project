A fourth-year project entitled Supreme Shuttle Fleet Management System.
The system is used to manage PSV vehicles and drivers of Supreme Shuttle Company.
To access the system as an admin click login button on the navbar.
Then create an account, then login with credentials.
I have already created an account so use the following login credentials
Username:geraldprogrammer20232@gmail.com
Password:123
Also, there is a drivers portal accessed after login out and on the right side of the navbar you can click "Drivers Portal Button". For instance, a driver can view their appraisal report by inputting their ID number e.g. 1234567. They can also download various documents related to their work. In addition, they can  send messages to the admin.
